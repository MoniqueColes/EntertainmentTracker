BooksAndMovies in GitHub has bugs.  They are fixed in the remade repository named Entertainment Tracker. 


ASP.NET MVC

This app is used to track the books you’ve read, movies and shows you’ve watched, and theater productions you’ve seen.
You must first Register or Login in the top right corner of the navbar on the web page.

Once you are logged in you will see the choices of Entertainment Tracker, Books, Movies, Shows, Theater Productions and Comments in the top left corner on the navbar. Entertainment Tracker takes you back to the home page. The last choice, comments, is used only for books for now. The Books, Movies, Shows and Theater Productions links will take you to those pages where you can add new media, edit items or delete items.
The comments link allows you to add comments linked to book titles that have been added. The book has to be added before the comment can be made. The book title will be selected by a drop-down list. This is done by using a foreign key.
Future ideas: Cascading drop-down boxes to add comments to movies, shows and theater productions Season checkboxes for shows
